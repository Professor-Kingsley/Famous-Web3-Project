## Fluence


**Fluence: Decentralized Computing Platform**

Fluence is a decentralized computing platform designed to provide an alternative to centralized cloud infrastructure. It aims to enable developers to build and deploy cutting-edge products without being restricted by closed, proprietary systems or centralized backends.

**Key Features**

1. **Decentralized and Cloudless**: Fluence aggregates CPU resources from data centers worldwide to create a global, resilient, and decentralized computing platform (DePIN). This approach eliminates risks associated with centralized control, censorship, and data lock-in.

2. **Trustless and Verifiable**: The platform ensures trustlessness through crypto-economic incentives for compute providers and verifiability through cryptographic proofs of all computations.

3. **Cost-effective and Secure**: Fluence offers developers an inexpensive and auditable alternative to traditional cloud providers, with potential savings of up to 80%. It also enables decentralized and verifiable AI computations, ensuring transparent and uncensored outputs.

**Network Participants**

The Fluence network involves three main stakeholder groups:

1. **Compute Providers**: Contribute computing resources and receive capacity rewards and payments in USDC or ERC-20 tokens for fulfilling compute jobs.
2. **Delegators/Token Holders**: Stake the $FLT token with compute providers, earn staking rewards, and participate in governance.
3. **Customers/Developers**: Deploy serverless and verifiable compute jobs on the platform, paying with USDC or ERC-20 tokens.

**$FLT Token and Tokenomics**

Fluence utilizes a two-token model:

1. **$FLT**: The rewarding, staking, and governance token.
2. **USDC/ERC-20**: Payment tokens used by developers and customers to compensate compute providers.

The $FLT token incentivizes compute providers and ensures network trustlessness through staking requirements and rewards vesting.

**Fluence DAO and Developer Rewards**

The Fluence DAO, incorporated in Switzerland, governs the project and allows $FLT holders to determine the future of Fluence through voting. Additionally, 5% of the $FLT supply has been allocated as rewards for web3 developers, claimable within the next 12 months.

**Powered by InterPlanetary Consensus**

Fluence is the first project to launch on InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC), a scaling technology from Protocol Labs, enabling advanced cryptographic proof verification capabilities.
